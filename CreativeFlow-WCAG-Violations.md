## WCAG 1.4 Violations Identified

### 1. **Success Criterion 1.4.1 - Use of Color (Level A)**
*"Use more than color in your design"*

**Location:** Portfolio project status indicators
**Issue:** Project status conveyed only through color (green, yellow, blue dots)
**Impact:** Users with color blindness cannot distinguish between different project statuses
**Code Example:**
```html
<div class="w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-green-500"></div>
<span class="text-xs text-gray-400">Completed</span>
```
**Expected:** Status should be indicated through text, icons, or patterns in addition to color

---

### 2. **Success Criterion 1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)**
*"Make non-text items easier to see with contrast"*

**Location:** Multiple text elements
**Issue:** Insufficient color contrast ratios
**Specific Examples:**
- Brand Strategy description: `style="color: #999999"` on dark background
- Portfolio project description: `style="color: #666666"` on dark background
**Impact:** Text is difficult to read for users with visual impairments
**Expected:** Text should have minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text

---

### 3. **Success Criterion 1.4.5 - Images of Text (Level AA)**
*"Use text, not an image of text"*

**Location:** Site logo in header
**Issue:** Logo contains text rendered as an image
**Code Example:**
```html
<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,..." alt="CreativeFlow Marketing logo" />
```
**Impact:** Text in images cannot be resized, has poor quality when zoomed, and may not be accessible to screen readers
**Expected:** Use actual text with CSS styling instead of text embedded in images

---

### 4. **Success Criterion 1.4.11 - Non-text Contrast (Level AA)**
*"Make text easier to see with contrast"*

**Location:** Interactive elements (buttons, form fields, focus indicators)
**Issue:** UI components and states have insufficient contrast against their background
**Specific Examples:**
- Button borders: `border: 1px solid #4A5568;` on dark background
- Form focus indicators: `.poor-focus:focus { outline: 1px solid #666666; }`
**Impact:** Interactive elements are difficult to perceive, especially for users with visual impairments
**Expected:** Non-text UI elements should have minimum contrast ratio of 3:1

---

### 5. **Success Criterion 1.4.13 - Content on Hover or Focus (Level AA)**
*"Content has to be accessible"*

**Location:** Tooltip elements in portfolio and services sections
**Issue:** Hover-triggered content that cannot be easily accessed or dismissed
**Code Example:**
```html
<h3 class="tooltip-hover" data-tooltip="Strategic planning for brand positioning">Brand Strategy</h3>
<span class="absolute... opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 pointer-events-none">
    Includes logo design, color schemes, typography
</span>
```
**Impact:** 
- Content appears only on hover, making it inaccessible to keyboard users
- Tooltips disappear immediately when cursor moves away
- No way to dismiss content with keyboard
- Cannot interact with tooltip content due to `pointer-events-none`
**Expected:** Additional content should be hoverable, dismissible, and persistent
