**Location:** Services section icons
**Issue:** Missing alternative text for decorative service icons
**Impact:** Screen reader users cannot understand what the icons represent
**Code Example:**
```html
<img src="data:image/svg+xml..." class="w-8 h-8" />
```
**Expected:** Icons should have descriptive alt text or be marked as decorative

---

### 2. **Success Criterion 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships (Level A)**

**Location:** Contact form select dropdown
**Issue:** Select element lacks proper labeling
**Impact:** Form fields are not programmatically associated with their purposes
**Code Example:**
```html
<select class="w-full px-4 py-3...">
    <option value="">Select Service Type</option>
```
**Expected:** Form elements should have proper labels or aria-label attributes

### 3. **Success Criterion 1.4.1 - Use of Color (Level A)**

**Location:** Portfolio project status indicators
**Issue:** Project status conveyed only through color (green, yellow, blue dots)
**Impact:** Users with color blindness cannot distinguish between different project statuses
**Code Example:**
```html
<div class="w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-green-500"></div>
<span class="text-xs text-gray-400">Completed</span>
```
**Expected:** Status should be indicated through text, icons, or patterns in addition to color

**Issue:** Insufficient color contrast ratios
**Specific Examples:**
- Brand Strategy description: `style="color: #999999"` on dark background
- Portfolio project description: `style="color: #666666"` on dark background
**Impact:** Text is difficult to read for users with visual impairments
**Expected:** Text should have minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text

### 5. **Success Criterion 1.4.5 - Images of Text (Level AA)**

**Expected:** Use actual text with CSS styling instead of text embedded in images

---

### 6. **Success Criterion 2.1.1 - Keyboard (Level A)**

**Location:** Contact form submit button
**Issue:** Submit button implemented as div with onclick instead of proper button element
**Code Example:**
```html
<div onclick="submitForm()" class="inline-block bg-blue-600...">
    Send Message
</div>
```
**Impact:** Button cannot be activated using keyboard navigation
**Expected:** Use proper button elements that are focusable and activatable via keyboard

---

### 7. **Success Criterion 2.4.4 - Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A)**

**Location:** Main navigation links

<a href="#" class="text-white hover:text-blue-300">Services</a>
```
**Impact:** Users cannot determine link purposes, especially when using screen readers
**Expected:** Links should have descriptive text or additional context about their purpose

---

### 8. **Success Criterion 3.3.1 - Error Identification (Level A)**

**Location:** Contact form
**Issue:** No form validation or error messages
**Impact:** Users cannot identify and correct input errors
**Expected:** Form should validate input and provide clear error messages

---

### 9. **Success Criterion 3.3.2 - Labels or Instructions (Level A)**

**Code Example:**
```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Your Name" class="w-full..." />
<input type="email" placeholder="Email Address" class="w-full..." />
```
**Impact:** Form fields are not properly labeled for assistive technologies
**Expected:** Each form field should have associated label elements

---

### 10. **Success Criterion 4.1.2 - Name, Role, Value (Level A)**

**Location:** Contact form elements and custom interactive elements
**Issue:** Custom div button lacks proper role and accessibility properties
**Impact:** Assistive technologies cannot understand the purpose and state of interactive elements
